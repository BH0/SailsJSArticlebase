# articlebase

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application





# Tasks To Do (Not exactly ordered)
* Implement Full-Article page - done
* Replace Bootstrap with FlexboxGrid
* Turn "article.ejs" into "articleFull.ejs" (to avoid namespace pollution)
* Examine using partials
    * Determine what should be a partial
* The "a href navigation links" don't appear to become highlighted (whiter) when
    the user is on the appropriate page - only "home" is
    * This may be Brad's choice so re-clone and test the original application to find out
* Style using SASS
    * Style edit button
    * Style delete button
    * Style navigation bar
* Replace bullet points with custom bullet point font / icon 
* Make it so that a user cannot submit and update blank articles - in progress
* Implement user accounts (and login + signup box) - 1 user or multiple users?
    * Will likely need a new model (DB term)  
* Add user permissions
* Add comment section to article full
* Organize folder + file structure better (will require some adjustments to the code)
* Share via Github
